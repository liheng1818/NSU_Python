    "A Python dictionary is a built-in data structure that stores a collection of key-value pairs. It is also known as a \"dict\" in Python and is implemented as a hash table. Dictionaries are widely used in Python for various purposes due to their efficiency in storing and retrieving data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Key-Value Pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary consists of key-value pairs. Each key is unique within a dictionary, and it maps to a specific value. Keys are typically strings or numbers, while values can be of any data type, including numbers, strings, lists, other dictionaries, or even user-defined objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Creating a Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a dictionary using curly braces `{}` and specifying key-value pairs separated by colons `:`. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3. Accessing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access the values in a dictionary by using square brackets `[]` and providing the key. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(my_dict['name'])  # Output: 'John'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that if you try to access a key that doesn't exist, it will raise a `KeyError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4. Modifying Values\n",
    "\n",
    "You can change the value associated with a key by assigning a new value to that key:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dict['age'] = 31\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5. Adding New Key-Value Pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add new key-value pairs to a dictionary by simply assigning a value to a new key:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dict['gender'] = 'Male'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6. Removing Key-Value Pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "You can remove a key-value pair from a dictionary using the `del` statement or the `pop()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "del my_dict['city']  # Removes the 'city' key-value pair\n",
    "popped_value = my_dict.pop('age')  # Removes the 'age' key-value pair and returns the value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.7. Checking for Key Existence\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check if a key exists in a dictionary using the `in` keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if 'name' in my_dict:\n",
    "      print(\"Name exists in the dictionary.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.8. Dictionary Methods:\n",
    "   - `keys()`: Returns a list of all the keys in the dictionary.\n",
    "   - `values()`: Returns a list of all the values in the dictionary.\n",
    "   - `items()`: Returns a list of key-value pairs as tuples.\n",
    "   - `get(key, default)`: Returns the value for a given key, or a default value if the key is not found.\n",
    "   - `clear()`: Removes all key-value pairs from the dictionary.\n",
    "   - `copy()`: Returns a shallow copy of the dictionary.\n",
    "   - `update(other_dict)`: Merges the dictionary with another dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.9. Dictionary Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Like list comprehensions, you can create dictionaries using dictionary comprehensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squares = {x: x*x for x in range(1, 6)}\n",
    "# Output: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.10. Nested Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "You can have dictionaries within dictionaries, creating a nested structure to store more complex data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "employee = {\n",
    "      'name': 'John',\n",
    "      'info': {\n",
    "            'age': 30,\n",
    "            'city': 'New York'\n",
    "      }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```"

    "\n",
    "**Opening Files**\n",
    "   - You can open a file using the `open()` function. It takes two arguments: the filename and the mode in which you want to open the file (read, write, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Opening a file for reading\n",

    "\n",
    "**Closing Files**\n",
    "   - It's important to close files after you're done with them to release system resources.\n",
    "   - You can close a file using the `close()` method of the file object:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   file.close()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
