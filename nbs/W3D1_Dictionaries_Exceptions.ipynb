    "# 1. Dictionaries"

  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "A Python dictionary is a built-in data structure that stores a collection of key-value pairs. It is also known as a \"dict\" in Python and is implemented as a hash table. Dictionaries are widely used in Python for various purposes due to their efficiency in storing and retrieving data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Key-Value Pairs**: A dictionary consists of key-value pairs. Each key is unique within a dictionary, and it maps to a specific value. Keys are typically strings or numbers, while values can be of any data type, including numbers, strings, lists, other dictionaries, or even user-defined objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Creating a Dictionary**: You can create a dictionary using curly braces `{}` and specifying key-value pairs separated by colons `:`. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Accessing Values**: You can access the values in a dictionary by using square brackets `[]` and providing the key. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(my_dict['name'])  # Output: 'John'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   It's important to note that if you try to access a key that doesn't exist, it will raise a `KeyError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Modifying Values**: You can change the value associated with a key by assigning a new value to that key:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_dict['age'] = 31\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Adding New Key-Value Pairs**: You can add new key-value pairs to a dictionary by simply assigning a value to a new key:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_dict['gender'] = 'Male'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Removing Key-Value Pairs**: You can remove a key-value pair from a dictionary using the `del` statement or the `pop()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   del my_dict['city']  # Removes the 'city' key-value pair\n",
    "   popped_value = my_dict.pop('age')  # Removes the 'age' key-value pair and returns the value\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Checking for Key Existence**: You can check if a key exists in a dictionary using the `in` keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if 'name' in my_dict:\n",
    "       print(\"Name exists in the dictionary.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Dictionary Methods**:\n",
    "   - `keys()`: Returns a list of all the keys in the dictionary.\n",
    "   - `values()`: Returns a list of all the values in the dictionary.\n",
    "   - `items()`: Returns a list of key-value pairs as tuples.\n",
    "   - `get(key, default)`: Returns the value for a given key, or a default value if the key is not found.\n",
    "   - `clear()`: Removes all key-value pairs from the dictionary.\n",
    "   - `copy()`: Returns a shallow copy of the dictionary.\n",
    "   - `update(other_dict)`: Merges the dictionary with another dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Dictionary Comprehensions**: Like list comprehensions, you can create dictionaries using dictionary comprehensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   squares = {x: x*x for x in range(1, 6)}\n",
    "   # Output: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Dictionary Ordering**: Starting from Python 3.7, dictionaries maintain the order of key-value pairs as they were inserted. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries were unordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Nested Dictionaries**: You can have dictionaries within dictionaries, creating a nested structure to store more complex data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   employee = {\n",
    "       'name': 'John',\n",
    "       'info': {'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Dictionary Use Cases**: Dictionaries are useful for tasks such as caching, mapping, counting occurrences of items, and organizing data in a structured way.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Hashable Keys**: Keys in a dictionary must be hashable, which means they should be immutable and have a consistent hash value. Common hashable types include strings, numbers, and tuples."
