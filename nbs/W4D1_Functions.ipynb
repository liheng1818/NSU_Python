    "- **Functions** are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task in Python. A function in Python is defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and a pair of parentheses `( )`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Function name:\n",
    "    - You can also specify parameters (input values) within the parentheses.\n",
    "    - Function names should be descriptive and follow naming conventions (usually lowercase with underscores for multiple words).\n",
    "    - Function names must be unique within the same scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Return value: Functions can return a value to the caller using the `return` statement. If no return statement is used, the function returns `None` by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Function body:\n",
    "    - The function body is indented and contains the code that defines what the function does.\n",
    "    - It can include any Python statements, including loops, conditionals, and other function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Function call: To use a function, you call it by using its name followed by parentheses, and you can pass arguments (values) as inputs to the function.\n",

    "### 1.5. Lambda Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python lambda function is a small, anonymous function defined using the `lambda` keyword. Lambda functions are also known as anonymous functions or lambda expressions. They are used when you need a simple, short function for a specific purpose, and you don't want to go through the process of defining a full-fledged named function using the `def` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntax of Lambda Functions:**\n",
    "   - The basic syntax of a lambda function is as follows:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   lambda arguments: expression\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Anonymous Functions:**\n",
    "   - Lambda functions are anonymous because they do not have a name.\n",
    "   - They are typically used for small, one-time operations where defining a named function would be unnecessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single Expression:**\n",
    "   - Lambda functions can contain only a single expression, which is evaluated and returned as the result of the function.\n",
    "   - The expression should not contain statements or multiple expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Cases:**\n",
    "   - Lambda functions are often used as arguments to higher-order functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.\n",
    "   - They are useful for creating short, throwaway functions for specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examples of Lambda Functions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Example 1: Adding Two Numbers**\n",
    "   \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
    "     result = add(3, 4)  # result will be 7\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Example 2: Squaring a Number**\n",
    "   \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     square = lambda x: x ** 2\n",
    "     result = square(5)  # result will be 25\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Example 3: Sorting a List of Tuples by the Second Element**\n",
    "   \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     data = [(1, 5), (3, 2), (2, 8)]\n",
    "     sorted_data = sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[1])\n",
    "     # sorted_data will be [(3, 2), (1, 5), (2, 8)]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Using Lambda Functions with Higher-Order Functions:**\n",
    "   - Lambda functions are commonly used with functions that accept other functions as arguments.\n",
    "   - For example, the `map()` function can be used with a lambda function to apply an operation to each element of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "   squared = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))\n",
    "   # squared will be [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Limitations:**\n",
    "   - Lambda functions are limited in complexity because they can contain only a single expression.\n",
    "   - They are not suitable for functions with multiple statements or complex logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Readability Considerations:**\n",
    "   - While lambda functions can be concise, they should not be used for very complex operations, as they can reduce code readability.\n",
    "   - For more complex tasks, it's often better to define a named function using `def` for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No Return Statement:**\n",
    "   - Lambda functions do not have a `return` statement; they automatically return the result of the expression they contain."
