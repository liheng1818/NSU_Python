    "A Python class is a blueprint or template for creating objects (instances). It defines the structure and behavior of objects of that class. Classes serve as a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) and play a central role in organizing and structuring code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts and Terminology:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class Definition:**\n",
    "   - A class is defined using the `class` keyword, followed by the class name and a colon (`:`). For example: `class MyClass:`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Attributes:**\n",
    "   - Attributes are data members of a class that hold information about the state of an object.\n",
    "   - They are defined within a class and accessed using the dot notation (e.g., `obj.attribute`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Methods:**\n",
    "   - Methods are functions defined within a class that perform operations on objects of that class.\n",
    "   - They are also accessed using the dot notation (e.g., `obj.method()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Constructor (`__init__` method):**\n",
    "   - The `__init__` method is a special method (sometimes called the constructor) that is automatically called when an object is created from a class.\n",
    "   - It is used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Self:**\n",
    "   - In Python, the first parameter of every instance method is conventionally named `self`.\n",
    "   - It represents the instance of the class and allows you to access its attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defining a Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example of defining a Python class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} says woof!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define a `Dog` class with attributes `name` and `age`, and a method `bark`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accessing Attributes and Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access an object's attributes and methods using the dot notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(dog1.name)  # Accessing an attribute\n",
    "dog1.bark()       # Calling a method\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class Variables vs. Instance Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Class variables are shared among all instances of a class and are defined within the class but outside any methods.\n",
    "- Instance variables are specific to each object and are defined within methods using `self`."

    "An object is an instance of a class, and it represents a real-world entity, concept, or thing within a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics of Python Objects:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Instance of a Class:** An object is created based on a class, which serves as a blueprint or template for defining its attributes and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Attributes (Properties):** Objects have attributes, also known as properties, which are variables that hold data related to the object's state. These attributes are defined within the class and can vary from one object to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Methods (Functions):** Objects have methods, which are functions defined within the class that allow the object to perform specific actions or behaviors. Methods are used to interact with and manipulate the object's data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Identity:** Each object has a unique identity that distinguishes it from other objects. You can check the identity of an object using the `id()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Type:** Objects have a type that defines their class. You can check the type of an object using the `type()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Behavior:** Objects can exhibit different behaviors based on their class and the methods defined within that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating Objects:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are created by instantiating a class. To create an object, you call the class as if it were a function, and it returns an instance of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating an object of class MyClass\n",
    "obj = MyClass()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accessing Object Attributes and Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access an object's attributes and methods using the dot notation (`object.attribute` or `object.method()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Accessing an attribute\n",
    "obj.attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling a method\n",
    "obj.method()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define a simple class\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I'm {self.age} years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an object of the Person class\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing attributes and calling a method\n",
    "print(person1.name)  # Access attribute\n",
    "person1.greet()      # Call method\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamically Adding Attributes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can dynamically add attributes to an object even if they were not defined in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Dynamically adding an attribute\n",
    "obj.new_attribute = \"New Value\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deleting Attributes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can delete attributes from an object using the `del` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Deleting an attribute\n",
    "del obj.attribute\n",

    "### 2.3. 4 pilars of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encapsulation:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes or properties) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class.\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Encapsulation hides the internal details of how an object works, exposing a controlled interface for interacting with it. It ensures that the object's state is modified only through well-defined methods, providing data integrity and security.\n",
    "   - **Example:** In a `Car` class, attributes like `make`, `model`, and `year` are encapsulated, and methods like `start` and `stop` control the car's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inheritance:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Inheritance is the mechanism that allows one class (the subclass or derived class) to inherit the attributes and methods of another class (the superclass or base class). It promotes code reuse and supports the creation of more specialized classes.\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Inheritance allows you to define a new class based on an existing class, inheriting its attributes and behaviors. This simplifies code maintenance and facilitates the creation of hierarchies of classes with shared characteristics.\n",
    "   - **Example:** A `Vehicle` class can be a superclass with common attributes like `speed` and `fuel`, and subclasses like `Car` and `Motorcycle` can inherit these attributes and add their own specific attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Polymorphism:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Polymorphism, derived from Greek words meaning \"many forms,\" is the ability to use objects of different classes through a common interface. In OOP, it can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Polymorphism allows different classes to provide their own implementations for methods with the same name and parameters, making it possible to write code that works with objects of various types without knowing their specific classes.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Different animal classes (e.g., `Dog`, `Cat`, `Bird`) can have a common method called `make_sound()`, and polymorphism allows you to call `make_sound()` on any animal object, and the correct sound is produced based on the object's class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Abstraction:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes and objects at the appropriate level of detail. It focuses on essential properties and behaviors while hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Abstraction allows you to create a high-level model of a system that captures the most important aspects while omitting less important details. It makes code more understandable, reduces complexity, and facilitates communication among team members.\n",
    "   - **Example:** When modeling a `BankAccount` class, you may abstract it to have essential attributes like `balance` and methods like `deposit` and `withdraw`, while omitting complex details of transaction processing."

    "### 2.4 super()\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python's object-oriented programming (OOP), `super()` is a built-in function that provides a way to call a method from a parent or superclass within a subclass. It is commonly used when you want to extend or override methods in a subclass while still retaining the functionality of the overridden method from the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Accessing Parent Class Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a subclass, you can use `super()` to call a method or constructor (the `__init__` method) of the parent class, allowing you to reuse code from the superclass.\n",
    "- This is particularly useful when you want to extend the behavior of the parent class's method without completely replacing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `super()` function is typically used within a subclass's method.\n",
    "- The basic syntax for using `super()` is as follows:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class Subclass(ParentClass):\n",
    "      def __init__(self, args):\n",
    "          super().__init__(args)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  In the above code:\n",
    "  - `Subclass` is the name of the subclass you are defining.\n",
    "  - `ParentClass` is the name of the parent class that the subclass is inheriting from.\n",
    "  - `__init__` is an example method, but you can use `super()` with any method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Calling Parent Class Constructor:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A common use of `super()` is to call the constructor of the parent class in the subclass's constructor to initialize inherited attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Multiple Inheritance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In cases of multiple inheritance (a class inheriting from more than one superclass), `super()` is useful for specifying the exact superclass whose method you want to call.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def show_info(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Name: {self.name}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name)  # Call the constructor of the parent class\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def show_info(self):\n",
    "        super().show_info()  # Call the show_info method of the parent class\n",
    "        print(f\"Age: {self.age}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "child = Child(\"Alice\", 10)\n",
    "child.show_info()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `super()` is used in the `Child` class's constructor to call the constructor of the `Parent` class, and it's also used within the `show_info()` method of the `Child` class to call the `show_info()` method of the `Parent` class."
