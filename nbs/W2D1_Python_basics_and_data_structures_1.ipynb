    "- **Code or Source Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Code, also known as source code, refers to the sequence of instructions that constitute a computer program. It is the human-readable representation of a program's logic and functionality.\n",
    "    - Source code is written by programmers using a specific programming language, and it serves as the blueprint for the software or application being developed.\n",
    "    - Code can be organized into functions, classes, and modules, making it modular and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Syntax is a fundamental aspect of programming languages. It defines the set of rules and structures that dictate how code should be written in that language.\n",
    "    - Correct syntax ensures that the code is both understandable by humans and executable by computers. It enforces proper formatting, punctuation, and usage of language-specific keywords.\n",
    "    - Syntax errors occur when code violates these rules, preventing the program from running. Debugging involves identifying and fixing these errors to make the code syntactically correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Output in programming refers to the information, results, or messages produced by a program during its execution.\n",
    "    - Output can take various forms, including text, numbers, graphics, and more, depending on the program's purpose.\n",
    "    - It serves as a means of communication between the program and the user or other components of a software system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Console**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A console, in the context of programming, is a text-based interface or window where a program's output is displayed and where input can be entered.\n",
    "    - The console provides a means for users to interact with command-line applications by typing commands and receiving responses.\n",
    "    - It is commonly used for tasks like running scripts, debugging, and system administration.\n",
    "    - Console output typically includes text messages, warnings, error messages, and diagnostic information generated by the program."

    "**Compilation vs. Interpretation:**\n",
    "   - In many programming languages like C, C++, and Java, the code written by the programmer needs to be compiled before it can be executed. Compilation involves translating the human-readable source code into machine code or an intermediate form that the computer can understand.\n",
    "   - Compiled languages typically generate executable files that can be run independently of the source code. The compilation process checks for syntax errors and produces optimized code for performance.\n",
    "   - Python, on the other hand, is not a compiled language in the traditional sense. It is an interpreted language.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python as an Interpreted Language:**\n",
    "   - Python is often referred to as an interpreted language because Python code is executed directly by the Python interpreter without the need for a separate compilation step.\n",
    "   - When you run a Python script or program, the interpreter reads the source code line by line and executes it on-the-fly. This means you can make changes to your code and immediately see the results without recompiling.\n",
    "   - Python's interpreter handles tasks such as memory management and dynamic typing, making it easier to write and test code quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interactive Environment:**\n",
    "   - Python's interpreter provides an interactive environment known as the Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). In this environment, you can type Python expressions and statements interactively, and the interpreter evaluates them immediately.\n",
    "   - The Python REPL is an excellent tool for experimenting with code, testing small code snippets, and quickly verifying the behavior of functions and expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output of Expressions:**\n",
    "   - When you enter expressions or statements into the Python interpreter, the results of these expressions are printed directly to the screen.\n",
    "   - For example, if you enter `2 + 3` into the Python REPL, the interpreter will evaluate the expression and immediately display `5` as the result.\n",
    "   - This immediate feedback is valuable for learning and debugging."

    "In Python, an expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated to produce a result. Expressions are the building blocks of Python programs and are used to perform computations, assign values to variables, and make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics of Expressions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Values:** Expressions often include values, which can be literals (e.g., numbers, strings, booleans) or the results of previous computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variables:** Expressions can use variables, which represent values stored in memory. Variables must be defined before they are used in expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Operators:** Expressions can contain operators, which perform operations on values and variables. Python supports a wide range of operators, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Function Calls:** Expressions can include function calls, which execute predefined or user-defined functions and return values. The result of a function call can be part of an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Expressions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Arithmetic Expressions:** These expressions involve mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For example: `3 + 5 * 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Comparison Expressions:** These expressions compare values and return a boolean result. Common comparison operators include `==` (equal), `!=` (not equal), `<` (less than), `>` (greater than), etc. For example: `x > y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Logical Expressions:** These expressions use logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not` to combine boolean values or conditions. For example: `x > 5 and y < 10`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conditional (Ternary) Expressions:** These expressions provide a concise way to make decisions and assign values based on a condition. For example: `value = x if x > 0 else 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **List Comprehensions:** List comprehensions are expressions used to create new lists by applying an expression to each item in an iterable. For example: `[x**2 for x in range(5)]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **String Concatenation:** Expressions can be used to concatenate strings using the `+` operator. For example: `\"Hello, \" + \"world!\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Order of Evaluation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python follows a specific order of evaluation for expressions, known as operator precedence and associativity. This determines the sequence in which operators are applied within an expression. Parentheses can be used to override the default order of evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 3\n",
    "y = 5\n",
    "result = x + y * 2  # The * operator has higher precedence, so it's evaluated first.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expression vs. Statement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to distinguish between expressions and statements in Python. While expressions produce values, statements are used for tasks like variable assignment or control flow (e.g., `if`, `while`, `for`). Statements do not return values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = x + y  # Produces a value and assigns it to 'result'\n",
    "```"

    "**While Loops:**\n",
    "   While loops are used for executing a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. The syntax for a while loop is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   while condition:\n",
    "       # Code to be executed while the condition is true\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here's an example of a simple while loop that counts from 1 to 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   count = 1\n",
    "   while count <= 5:\n",
    "       print(count)\n",
    "       count += 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Output:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   1\n",
    "   2\n",
    "   3\n",
    "   4\n",
    "   5\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Be cautious when using while loops, as they can result in infinite loops if the condition is not properly controlled. You should ensure that the condition eventually becomes false.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loop Control Statements:**\n",
    "   Python provides several loop control statements to modify the behavior of loops:\n",
    "   - `break`: It terminates the loop prematurely when a certain condition is met.\n",
    "   - `continue`: It skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration.\n",
    "   - `else` clause: You can have an `else` block associated with a loop, which is executed when the loop completes normally (without a `break` statement).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here's an example of using `break` and `continue`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i in range(1, 11):\n",
    "       if i == 5:\n",
    "           break  # Terminate the loop when i is 5\n",
    "       if i % 2 == 0:\n",
    "           continue  # Skip even numbers\n",
    "       print(i)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Output:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   1\n",
    "   3\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nested Loops:**\n",
    "   You can also have loops within loops (nested loops). This is often used for working with multi-dimensional data structures or for performing more complex iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i in range(3):\n",
    "       for j in range(2):\n",
    "           print(f\"({i}, {j})\")\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "   (0, 1)\n",
    "   (1, 0)\n",
